"""Check .claude/graph.md against the repo and report where it has started lying.

Invoked from hooks/hooks.json on Stop (blocking) and SessionStart (advisory).
Python 3 stdlib only. Exits 0 always — a broken checker must never break a turn.

Three checks:
  1. dead path    — a path named in the graph no longer exists            (hard)
  2. dead symbol  — a symbol in a Key-symbols cell is gone from its module (hard)
  3. unmapped dir — a code directory with no row in the graph             (soft)

New symbols appearing in a mapped module are NOT drift: "Key symbols" is a
curated selection, not an inventory. Flagging those would nag on every edit.
